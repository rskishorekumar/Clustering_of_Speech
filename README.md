# Clustering_of_Speech

A Robust Unsupervised Pattern Discovery and Clustering of Speech Signals

Kishore Kumar R, Lokendra Birla, K Sreenivasa Rao

Our work deviates from standard speech recognition task, and aim to find the match between the the speech documents based on keyword match. Identification of keyword patterns helps in clustering the speech signals automatically. Our approach uses the posterior features derived from Gaussian Mixture Models(GMMs) to find the keywords between the speech signals. Also, uses image processing techniques and histogram-based method to extract only the word and phrase patterns. For demonstration, two Hindi speech  consisting of news data is given. 

Usage:

Through Matlab command prompt run the keyword spotting method as

Spotingkeywordmatchingindocument_f.m

The method outputs the match between the speech files. 

If the users wants to run any other database, posterior features of that data corpus should be given to the keyword spotting method and the features should be place in the appropriate folders.

Source code is tested in Matlab 2016B, Linux Environment.
